# Bruce Lee Atari rework

This is my typescript rework of an old-school platformer game. **Bruce Lee** was a platform game originally written by Ron J. Fortier for the Atari 8-bit family and published in 1984 by Datasoft. The plot involves the eponymous martial artist advancing from chamber to chamber in a wizard's tower, seeking to claim infinite wealth and the secret of immortality. There are twenty chambers, each represented by a single screen with platforms and ladders. To progress, the player must collect a number of lanterns suspended from various points in the chamber.
